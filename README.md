Ant-Colony Optimization for the Traveling Salesperson Problem

Video demonstration:

## Getting Started

### Via Command-Line
The simplest way to run this optimization is to run it on the command-line. Once this folder is cloned and placed under your local 'go/src/' directory, you may begin the following steps:
1. ```cd``` into the directory ```/go/src/Group16-FinalProject-02601/```
2. Run ``` git build ```
3. Run ```./Group16-FinalProject-02601```
4. Follow the instructions for inputting parameters as printed out on the command-line
5. The GIFs will save under this same directory, you will also be asked if you would like to save analysis-relevant data to .csv file.


### Via Web App
If you would like to runn the webapp version of this. Clone this repo under your local 'go/src/' directory and follow these steps:

1. Unzip the AntAlgorithmWebApp-Complete.zip file in your ```go/src/``` directory
- There should be two sub-folders: 'AntAlgorithmWebApp' and 'AntAlgorithm'

2. Simply run the setup script from here:
```AntAlgorithmWebApp/setup.sh```

3. It should then tell you that the server is live on your local machine (`localhost`)! Just copy and paste the url into your browser

4. Once the web app has loaded, input the parameters you would like and press go to see the GIF representing the Ant-Cycle Optimization of the TSP.
